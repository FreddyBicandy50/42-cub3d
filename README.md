## Project Idea

This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way.

## Usage

Clone the repository:

```shell
git https://github.com/FreddyBicandy50/42-cub3d.git
```

To compile:

```shell
cd 42-cub3d && make
```

To run the program:

```shell
./cub3d Maps/1.cub
```

## Guides

The most interesting part of any project is the research that goes behind it. If you are a student, please don't miss out on that opportunity by simply following guides such as these. In any case, they should under no circumstances be your only source of information about this project. Try things, fail, research, try again and succeed! And maybe write your own guide about it. Writing really is the best way to learn.
